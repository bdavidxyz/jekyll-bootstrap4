<h1 align="center">Impatient-Jekyll</h1>
<div align="center">Jekyll is the most awesome & most used static website generator.</div><div align="center"> But 1) Default dev workflow is <strong>slow</strong> 2) Generated website is <strong>not optimized</strong></div>
<p align="center">Impatient-Jekyll is the perfect solution to this 2 problems.</p>



## How to use it

### Prerequisite


 - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - use the installer
 - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - ```$ gem install jekyll```
 - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - use the installer.
 - [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/GulpJS) - ```$ npm install -g gulp ```

### Dev mode

```shell

$ git clone https://github.com/davidb583/impatient-jekyll
$ npm install
$ gulp
 # ta-da ! the browser launches itself,
 # and will rebuild and live-reload each time you
 # change a CSS, JS, or HTML file
```

### Production mode

The website will deploy on branch gh-pages, so create a new repository <your_repo_name> in Github, and add the remote in your project like this :


```shell

# be sure you start from a fresh GitHub state
$ rm -rf .git
$ git init
$ git add . && git commit -m 'initial commit'
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:<your_github_name>/<your_repo_name>.git
$ git push -u origin master

# I suppose you've already run npm install ?
$ gulp deploy
# ta-da ! your super optimized website
# can be see at  https://<your_github_name>/<your_repo_name>/
```


## How to customize it

There are very minor change compared to plained old Jekyll.

 - A gulpfile.js has been added
 - In config.yml, node artifact have been excluded from jekyll build
 - A folder named "js" contains all javascript files you want.
 - Default CSS inclusion in _includes/head.html has been modified to allow inclusion of minified CSS.
 - One line has been added to _layout/default.html in order to include the concatenated javascript.



 That's all ! So diving into source code to get the featurette you want should not be a big deal. If it is, just write me an email, I'll be glad to help you : davbohr at gmail dot com

## Limitations

As you may have noticed, the build does treat image. I strongly recommend the 2 following options :
- Rely on an external service like [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
- Use SVG as much as possible

Remember that speed is the goal of the tool:)
